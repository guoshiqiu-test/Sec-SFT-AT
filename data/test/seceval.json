The APK Signature Scheme v3 does not support key rotation, hence other apps will not recognize any changes to the signing certificate.\nB. The proof-of-rotation struct in APK Signature Scheme v3 actually allows apps to rotate their signing certificate without being blocked by other apps, ensuring trust continuity.\nC. Other apps will automatically trust the new signing certificate as the APK Signature Scheme v3 includes a feature that universally updates the trust stores of all Android devices.\nD. The APK Signature Scheme v3 requires manual intervention for every app to update their trust stores, which guarantees that no app will be automatically blocked.\n\nOutput the correct option in \\boxed{}, such as \\boxed{A}",

    "question": "In an effort to bolster your web server's security against evasion attacks, you are considering deploying HIDS. A colleague claims that by installing HIDS, the server will be fully protected against path traversal attacks. Based on your understanding of how HIDS operates, which of the following would be the best counterargument to your colleague's claim?\n\nA. HIDS is ineffective against path traversal attacks because it only analyzes network traffic and not the file system's interpretation of requests.\nB. To fully defend against path traversal attacks, HIDS must not only understand the contents of the end request but also how the underlying file system interprets these contents, which could still lead to parsing inconsistencies and evasion attacks.\nC. Path traversal attacks are not a concern for HIDS because they typically rely on exploiting the network layer, which HIDS is adept at monitoring and defending.\nD. Installing HIDS on the server would make the system more vulnerable to path traversal attacks, as it may introduce additional security flaws.\n\nOutput the correct option in \\boxed{}, such as \\boxed{A}",

    "question": "Why should an application not rely solely on removing dangerous characters like '../' from user input as its mitigation strategy against path traversal vulnerabilities?\n\nA. This approach is equivalent to a denylist which might not be comprehensive and could miss certain attack vectors due to encoding issues or alternative traversal sequences.\nB. Special characters like '../' are needed for normal application operation and cannot be removed without impacting functionality.\nC. Only removing dangerous characters does not enforce strict input validation on length, type, or acceptable values as required.\nD. This method will cause the application to be incompatible with non-English file systems that do not use '../' as a traversal sequence.\n\nOutput the correct option in \\boxed{}, such as \\boxed{A}",
    "solution": "A"

    "question": "While reflective code loading allows adversaries to execute payloads within the memory of a legitimate process, potentially evading file-based detection mechanisms, what is a potential drawback of this technique that a well-configured defensive system might exploit to identify malicious activity?\n\nA. The inability to execute payloads in the memory of systems with robust network security measures.\nB. The execution of arbitrary code may still be detected by monitoring for abnormal process behavior or API usage.\nC. Reflective loading exclusively targets Linux platforms, making it ineffective against Windows or macOS systems.\nD. The technique can be easily thwarted by regularly updating the operating system and software applications.\n\nOutput the correct option in \\boxed{}, such as \\boxed{A}",
    "solution": "B"
